Hi there! I am a PhD Candidate in [Geometry in Machine Learning](https://geometryinml.cs.uni-bonn.de/) in University of Bonn and [Lamarr Institut](https://lamarr-institute.org/de/), under the supervision of [Zorah Lähner](https://lamarr-institute.org/person/lahner-zorah/). I am currently in my second year with an interest in bridging 3D computer vision and computer graphics. Specifically, I work on 3D reconstruction of Gaussian Splatting and novel view synthesis for non-Lambertian objects such as reflective and transparent objects. Prior to that, I graduated from IP-Paris(X + MVA) with highest honor, under the supervision of [Mathieu Aubry](https://mathieuaubry.github.io/) and [Loic Landrieu](https://loiclandrieu.com/), and from University of Science and Technology of China, under the supervision of [Xinmin Hou](https://faculty.ustc.edu.cn/houxinmin/en/index.htm).
